Spark’s Language APIs
-------

Apache Spark is one of the most popular framework for big data analysis released in 2010 by Berkeley's AMPLab. Spark is primarily written in Scala, making it Spark’s 
“default” language, but one of spark's selling point is the cross-language API that allows you to write Spark code in Scala, Java, Python, R or SQL. 


### Scala : 
Scala is a highly Scalable Language and a crossover between object-oriented and functional programming language. Scala was invented by the German Computer Scientist, 
Martin Odersky and the first version was launched in the year 2003.  It runs on JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and interoperates with existing Java code and libraries.
Scala is the native language of Spark. It means any new API always first be available in Scala. It is also the only language that supports the typed Dataset functionality 
and, along with Java, allows one to write proper UDAFs (User Defined Aggregation Functions).
