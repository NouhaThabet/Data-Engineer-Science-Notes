Why we call some data "Big Data" ?
------------

Big Data refers to the huge collections of data that may be sourced from servers, customer profile information, order and purchase data, financial transactions, ledgers, 
search history, and employee records. In large companies, this data collection is continuously growing with time. You can read the 
[Source_Of_Data.md](https://github.com/nouhaaa/Data-Engineer-Notes/blob/main/General%20Introduction%20to%20Big%20Data/Source_Of_Data.md) file, to understand from where data is generated.


## The 3 V's of Big Data :


3 V’s contains 3 main characteristics of Big Data. These characteristics are Volume, Velocity and Variety. Each keyword are self explanatory. Each *characteristics demonstrate separate physical as well as logical attributes.

We will discuss above the 3 main cracteristics of Big Data : 


### 1 - Volume 

Volume refers to the vast amount of data being generated every second of every day.

The International Data Corporation (IDC), forecasts that the amount of data that exists in the world is growing from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to 177 zettabytes by 2025.
Just to put that into perspective, the computer that I'm using has 256GB of storage. That’s equivalent to just .000000000256 (9 zeros) zettabytes.


Organizations working with big data find ways to process, store and analyze data coming in at massive volumes that surpass traditional methods process and store data.


### 2 - Velocity

The second characteristic that defines big data is velocity, which refers to the speed at which new data is generated and the speed at which data moves around.

A good example of data velocity is a social media post going viral in seconds.


Another example is the speed at which credit card transactions are checked for fraudulent activities. Have you ever tried to purchase something you don't normally purchase and had that transaction declined? In just a matter of seconds, your credit card company received information about your purchase, was able to compare it to usual purchases you make and decide whether or not to flag this as a fraudulent transaction. 


### 3 - Variety

Data variety refers to the many different types of data that exist today - social media posts, credit card transactions, legal contracts, biometric data and geographic information, just to name a few.

Organizations working with big data find ways to use different types of data together - for example, an organization might want to extract data insights from a combination of social media posts, customer transaction records and real-time product usage.





_**`Now, apart from this 3 V’s definition, which is broadly accepted, there are several authors that claim that there is something missing in this 3V’s definition. Given that the IT industry seems to love acronyms, if you google it, you can find the 4 V’s of Big Data, the 5 V’s, the 8 V’s … and why not, even the 42 V’s of Big Data! (Shafer 2017). `**_



## The 5 V's of Big Data :


5 V’s contains Volume, Velocity, Variety, Variability and Value. Therefore, simply the concept of 5 V’s is “5 V’s = 3 V’s + Veracity + Value”. The Veracity and Value are described as follows:


### 4 - Veracity

It refers to inconsistencies and uncertainty in data, that is data which is available can sometimes get messy and quality and accuracy are difficult to control.

Big Data is also variable because of the multitude of data dimensions resulting from multiple disparate data types and sources.

Example: Data in bulk could create confusion whereas less amount of data could convey half or Incomplete Information.



### 5 - Value

After having the 4 V’s into account there comes one more V which stands for Value!. The bulk of Data having no Value is of no good to the company, unless you turn it into something useful.

Data in itself is of no use or importance but it needs to be converted into something valuable to extract Information. Hence, you can state that Value! is the most important V of all the 5V’s.
