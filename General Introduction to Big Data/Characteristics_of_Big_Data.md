Why we call some data "Big Data" ?
------------

Big Data refers to the huge collections of data that may be sourced from servers, customer profile information, order and purchase data, financial transactions, ledgers, 
search history, and employee records. In large companies, this data collection is continuously growing with time. You can read the [Source_Of_Data.md](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file, to understand from where data is generated.


We will discuss above the 3 main cracteristics of Big Data : 

### 1 - Volume 

Volume refers to the vast amount of data being generated every second of every day.

The International Data Corporation (IDC), forecasts that the amount of data that exists in the world is growing from 33 zettabytes in 2018 to 177 zettabytes by 2025.
Just to put that into perspective, the computer that I'm using has 256GB of storage. Thatâ€™s equivalent to just .000000000256 (9 zeros) zettabytes.


Organizations working with big data find ways to process, store and analyze data coming in at massive volumes that surpass traditional methods process and store data.
