Where Data come from ?
------------

In the last two decades, the volume and speed with which data is generated has changed beyond measures of human comprehension. The total amount of data in the world was **4.4 zettabytes in 2013**. That is set to rise steeply to **44 zettabytes by 2020**.
To put that in perspective, 44 zettabytes is equivalent to 44 trillion gigabytes. Even with the most advanced technologies today, it is impossible to analyze all this data. The need to process these increasingly larger (and unstructured) data sets is how traditional data analysis transformed into ‘Big Data’ in the last decade.

The three main sources of data are : 
- Human-generated

- Machine-generated

- Organization-generated

Now I will explain how data comes from each source above.
